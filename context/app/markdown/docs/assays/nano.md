### Last Updated: 12/18/2020

This document details Nano-DESI & nanoPOTS IMS data states, metadata fields, and file structure, QA/QC thresholds, and data processing.

## Description:
**nanoDESI:**
Nano-Desorption Electrospray Ionization (Nano-DESI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) combines ambient ionization mass spectrometry with spatial localization by liquid extraction of molecules from surfaces for highly sensitive quantitative detection of molecules in complex chemical and biological samples. Nano-DESI IMS is widely used to study biological analytes including metabolites, lipids, peptides and proteins. In summary, tissue is sectioned and mounted onto conductive glass slide. Endogenous biological analytes are then extracted from selected spatial coordinates across the tissue with solvent which is then analyzed by mass spectrometry . By rastering the region of interest, analytes are extracted at each pixel coordinate and ionized in the ESI source, which enables the collection of m/z spectrum at each pixel. The spatial resolution is determined by the size of the liquid bridge between two capillaries, the scan rate (stage moving speed) and the acquisition rate (the number of spectra acquired per second). Spatial resolution of better than 25µm can be achieved with microfluidic probes. In addition, two channels can be integrated on a glass chip. (The data generated for HuBMAP was generated with both sampling techniques). Finally, Ion images are generated by plotting the m/z signal intensities at each pixel.

**NanoPOTS:**
Nanodroplet Processing in One Pot for Trace Samples (Nano-POTS) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) utilizes a chip consisting of a microfabricated glass slide with nano-wells in which samples and reagents are combined. Tissue is sectioned and mounted onto the glass slide. Endogenous biological analytes are then extracted across the tissue with solvent which releases the contents into the nanowells. A robotic arm then extracts the sample/reagent mixture from each nanowell for LC-MS/MS analysis and an analyte profile per nanowell is generated. Nanowell spatial coordinates thereby represent pseudo-pixels which are used to synthesize an “image” of analyte profiles across the tissue slice. A Trelliscope software platform is used to visualize and share the data.

**Figure 2:** *Nano-DESI IMS is performed by scanning the sample with a liquid bridge formed between the primary capillary and Nanospray capillary so that analytes are extracted from the sample surface at each pixel. The spatial resolution is determined by the liquid bridge size at each pixel and the scan rate.*

## QC/QA for Level 1 nano-DESI HuBMAP Data
To monitor nanoDESI and the mass spec analyzer performance, the liquid bridge size and signal intensity are monitored before acquisition. Mass calibration is performed prior to each experiment using ESI-L tune mix (Agilent). Flow rate and capillary positions are adjusted to optimize signal and spatial resolution. The shear force probes are tuned prior to each experiment and test lines are acquired away from the imaging region to monitor its performance, signal intensity and stability.

Post-acquisition processing of MS/MS data will include high-stringency filtering criteria including a peptide length > 7 amino acid residues long, at least two uniquely mapping peptides, and a false discovery rate with a maximum allowable protein-level FDR of 1%.  Standards will be run prior to each sample batch to ensure high quality instrument performance.
