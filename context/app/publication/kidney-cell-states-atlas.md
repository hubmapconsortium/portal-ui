abstract: >
  Understanding kidney disease relies upon defining the complexity of
  cell types and states, their associated molecular profiles, and interactions
  within tissue neighborhoods. We have applied multiple single-cell or -nucleus
  assays (>400,000 nuclei/cells) and spatial imaging technologies to a broad
  spectrum of healthy reference (n = 42) and disease (n = 42) kidneys. This has
  provided a high resolution cellular atlas of 100 cell types that include rare
  and novel cell populations. The multi-omic approach provides detailed
  transcriptomic profiles, epigenomic regulatory factors, and spatial
  localizations for major cell types spanning the entire kidney. We further
  identify and define cellular states altered in kidney injury, encompassing
  cycling, adaptive or maladaptive repair, transitioning and degenerative states
  affecting several segments. Molecular signatures of these states permitted
  their localization within injury neighborhoods using spatial transcriptomics,
  and large-scale 3D imaging analysis of ∼1.2 million neighborhoods provided
  linkages to active immune responses. These analyses further defined biological
  pathways relevant to injury niches, including signatures underlying the
  transition from reference to predicted maladaptive states that were associated
  with a decline in kidney function during chronic kidney disease. This human
  kidney cell atlas, including injury cell states and neighborhoods, will be a
  valuable resource for future studies.
